# Copilot Game Type-along: Snake — Session Plan

## Overview
A short, focused type-along to build a minimal playable Snake game using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. The document contains goals, setup, step-by-step tasks, and improved prompts to use with Copilot.

## Quickstart (Copilot exercise)
Part 1: Understanding Copilot (5 minutes)
- Create a new file called `game.js`.
- Type this line: `// function to add two numbers`
- Press Enter, wait ~2 seconds, and observe Copilot suggestions.
- Press Tab to accept or Escape to dismiss.
- Delete the test file when done.

## Prompts
Use these refined prompts when interacting with Copilot or asking for help.

### Prompt 1 — Tech recommendation
"I want to create a simple Snake game. Which technologies should I use for a fast MVP? Explain pros/cons briefly."

### Prompt 2 — Project structure
"Show me a concise project structure for an HTML5 Canvas + JavaScript Snake game with brief purpose for each file."

### Prompt 3 — Generate files
"Generate the skeleton files for a Snake project: index.html, styles.css, game.js, README.md, and an assets/ folder (empty). Provide minimal placeholder content."

### Prompt 4 — Build MVP
"Build a fully playable MVP of the classic Snake game using HTML5 Canvas and vanilla JavaScript. Requirements: grid-based movement, fixed tick update, arrow key input, food spawn, growth on eating, and reset on collision with walls or self. Keep code simple and well commented."

### Prompt 5 — Iteration commands
- `/explain` — Ask Copilot to explain a code block or concept in plain language.
- `/review` — Request a quick code review focusing on correctness and edge cases.
- `refactor` — Ask to simplify or reorganize code for readability or performance.
